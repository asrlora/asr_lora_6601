# ASR6601 SDK

ASR6601 is a general LPWAN Wireless Communication SoC, with integrated RF Transceiver, Modem and a 32-bit RISC MCU. The RF Transceiver has continuous frequency coverage from 150 MHz to 960 MHz. The Modem supports LoRa modulation for LPWAN use cases and (G)FSK modulation for legacy use cases. The Modem also supports BPSK modulation in TX and (G)MSK modulation in TX and RX. The LPWAN Wireless Communication Module designed with ASR6601 provides ultralong range and ultra-low power communication for LPWAN application.

ASR6601 can achieve a high sensitivity to -148 dBm and the maximum transmit power is up to +22 dBm. This makes the chip suitable to be used in long range LPWAN and have high efficiency. The total chip package is of very small size, QFN 6 mm x 6 mm/QFN 8 mm x 8 mm.
